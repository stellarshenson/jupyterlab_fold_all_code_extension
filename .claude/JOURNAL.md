1. **Task - Project initialization**: Created new JupyterLab extension project `jupyterlab_fold_all_code_extension`<br>
   **Result**: Project scaffolded using JupyterLab extension cookiecutter template. Extension provides functionality to fold and expand all code cells in notebooks, helping create clean notebooks for non-technical audiences. Initial structure includes TypeScript source in `src/index.ts`, Python package in `jupyterlab_fold_all_code_extension/`, GitHub Actions workflows for build/release, and Playwright-based UI tests. Package configured for dual distribution via npm (`jupyterlab_fold_all_code_extension`) and PyPI (`jupyterlab-fold-all-code-extension`). Created `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with project-specific configuration importing workspace-level rules. Updated `README.md` with standardized badges and simplified feature documentation.
